In areas where housing costs are high, employers end up effectively transferring significant sums to landlords as the cost of attracting talent. But what will it take to fix this problem? Will market-based solutions suffice? If not, what kinds of interventions are necessary? Recent research shows that the market itself needs to be fixed. Any plan to overhaul the housing market needs to, first, confront the power of landlords to raise rents. Second, it requires rethinking public governance of housing markets behind simplistic prescriptions to just free the housing market from government regulation, assuming lower rents will follow. And third, it needs to provide more muscular government involvement in housing, through price regulation, more robust planning, and even direct public provision.","unwound_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240913103753/https://hbr.org/2024/09/the-market-alone-cant-fix-the-u-s-housing-crisis"}]},"geo":{},"id":"1834280375822286997","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":48,"reply_count":57,"like_count":213,"quote_count":33,"bookmark_count":95,"impression_count":161613},"reply_settings":"everyone","text":"I too, would like to live in a dense, walkable city. @sandeepvaheesan and I aren't convinced yimbyism gets us there. https://t.co/BBtCmJzrsP"}]}}
