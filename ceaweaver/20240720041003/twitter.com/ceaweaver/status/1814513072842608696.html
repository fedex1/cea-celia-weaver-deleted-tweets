Needs a Strong Good Cause!","description":"The City of Rochester is considering opting into the state Good Cause Eviction Law to give eligible tenants protections against unfair evictions and rent hikes, following the passage of a state law authorizing localities to adopt the policy. Passing Good Cause will give eligible tenants the right to renew their lease, challenge rent hikes, and fight no-fault evictions. But the City Council introduced a version of the bill with an LLC loophole that will leave too many tenants without protections. Tell Rochester leaders that you support moving quickly to adopt a strong version of Good Cause Eviction that covers as many Rochester tenants as possible!","unwound_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240720041003/https://actionnetwork.org/letters/rochester-needs-a-strong-good-cause?source=text"},{"start":226,"end":249,"url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240720041003/https://t.co/px7VCmtKch","expanded_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240720041003/https://twitter.com/RocTenantUnion/status/1814338406442566133/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/px7VCmtKch","media_key":"3_1814338402357063685"}]},"geo":{},"id":"1814338406442566133","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":12,"reply_count":2,"like_count":13,"quote_count":2,"bookmark_count":0,"impression_count":5100},"reply_settings":"everyone","text":"Every tenant, no matter where we live or who our landlord is, deserves the same protections against rent hikes and evictions.\n\nSign our petition for a strong #GoodCause Eviction that covers everybody.: https://t.co/YuJDYr7gHq https://t.co/px7VCmtKch"}]}}
