That's not right! Passing Good Cause Eviction in Fishkill will give eligible tenants a right to lease renewal, protections against unfair evictions, and the ability to challenge unreasonable rent hikes. If you pay your rent and don’t break the lease, you should be able to stay in your home and negotiate down sharp rent hikes. The Fishkill Town Board is considering opting into Good Cause Eviction protections, but need to hear from residents to do the right thing and adopt the strongest version that will cover the most tenants.","unwound_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240807195431/https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/pass-good-cause-eviction-protections-in-fishkill"},{"start":230,"end":253,"url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240807195431/https://t.co/LQlq2UHn4N","expanded_url":"https://web.archive.org/web/20240807195431/https://twitter.com/mhvdsa/status/1821271810018521427/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/LQlq2UHn4N","media_key":"3_1821271806130507776"}]},"geo":{},"id":"1821271810018521427","lang":"en","possibly_sensitive":false,"public_metrics":{"retweet_count":2,"reply_count":0,"like_count":4,"quote_count":0,"bookmark_count":0,"impression_count":78},"reply_settings":"everyone","text":"We've been canvassing Fishkill for Good Cause Eviction!
